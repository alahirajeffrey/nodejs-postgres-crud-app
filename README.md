## INTRODUCTION
This is a beginner friendly guide to using nodejs and postgreSQL to build restful APIs

## FEATURES
- CRUD operations i.e Create, Read, Update, Delete

## REQUIREMENTS
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/download/) is a powerful, open source object relational database system wih over 30 years of active development that has earned a reputation for reliability, feature robustness and performance
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is an API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing users to create and save simple and complex HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. The result - more efficient and less tedious work.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
